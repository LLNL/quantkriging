Description: A re-implementation of Quantile Kriging. Quantile Kriging was described by Matthew Plumlee & Rui Tuo in their 2014 paper "Building Accurate Emulators for Stochastic Simulations via Quantile Kriging."  With computational savings when dealing with replication from the recent paper "Practical heteroskedastic Gaussian process modeling for large simulation experiments " by Binois, M., Gramacy, R., and Ludovski, M. it is now possible to apply Quantile Kriging to a wider class of problems.  In addition to fitting the model, other useful tools are provided such as the ability to automatically perform leave-one-out cross validation.
